## Description
<b> This program encodes a message to a ppm file. </b>

Steganography is the art of hiding a message within another form of media: images, articles,
books, etc.  It is an ancient practice, dating back to approximately 1499. The cool thing about
messages encrypted with steganography is that if you don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs a message in the
image or file, it‚Äôs really hard to tell that there is a hidden message! A common example of this is
‚Äúinvisible ink‚Äù‚Äîunless you know that someone wrote on a paper with invisible ink, then you
wouldn‚Äôt know to hold it to heat to see the hidden message.
